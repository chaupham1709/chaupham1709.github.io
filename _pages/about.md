My name is Chau Pham. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at University
at Buffalo. I am advised by Professor [David Doermann](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~doermann/index.html). Before joining UB, I received the bachelor degree from the honors program at the School of Mechanical Engineering, Hanoi University of Science and Technology. In addition, I spent two years working as an AI Resident at VinAI, under the supervision of 
Dr. [Khoi Nguyen](https://www.khoinguyen.org/). 

My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, with a particular focus on advancing image/video generation by improving both quality and efficiency, as well as exploring its downstream applications, including image/video editing, personalization, and RL optimization. I am also interested in challenges surrounding Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), particularly personalization and reasoning, as well as leveraging LVLMs to enhance other tasks such as image generation and scene understanding.
