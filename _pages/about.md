My name is Chau Pham. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at University
at Buffalo. I am advised by Professor [David Doermann](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~doermann/index.html). Before joining UB, I received the bachelor degree from the honors program at the School of Mechanical Engineering, Hanoi University of Science and Technology. In addition, I spent two years working as an AI Resident at VinAI, under the supervision of 
Dr. [Khoi Nguyen](https://www.khoinguyen.org/). 

My research interests focus on Computer Vision problems, including Large Vision-Language Model and Image generation/editing. More specifically, I work on improving the current image generation/editing method, and combine the Large Vision-Language to improve the generation and perception problems.
